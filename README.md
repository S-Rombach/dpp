## Data

Collected from `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset/data`.

> The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a health-related telephone survey that is collected annually by the CDC. Each year, the survey collects responses from over 400,000 Americans on health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and the use of preventative services. It has been conducted every year since 1984. For this project, a csv of the dataset available on Kaggle for the year 2015 was used. This original dataset contains responses from 441,455 individuals and has 330 features. These features are either questions directly asked of participants, or calculated variables based on individual participant responses.

> This dataset contains 3 files:
>
>     diabetes_012_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv is a clean dataset of 253,680 survey responses to the CDC's BRFSS2015. The target variable Diabetes_012 has 3 classes. 0 is for no diabetes or only during pregnancy, 1 is for prediabetes, and 2 is for diabetes. There is class imbalance in this dataset. This dataset has 21 feature variables
>     diabetes_binary_5050split_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv is a clean dataset of 70,692 survey responses to the CDC's BRFSS2015. It has an equal 50-50 split of respondents with no diabetes and with either prediabetes or diabetes. The target variable Diabetes_binary has 2 classes. 0 is for no diabetes, and 1 is for prediabetes or diabetes. This dataset has 21 feature variables and is balanced.
>     diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv is a clean dataset of 253,680 survey responses to the CDC's BRFSS2015. The target variable Diabetes_binary has 2 classes. 0 is for no diabetes, and 1 is for prediabetes or diabetes. This dataset has 21 feature variables and is not balanced.

> Acknowledgements
> It it important to reiterate that I did not create this dataset, it is just a cleaned and consolidated dataset created from the BRFSS 2015 dataset already on Kaggle. That dataset can be found here and the notebook I used for the data cleaning can be found here.

> Zidian Xie et al for Building Risk Prediction Models for Type 2 Diabetes Using Machine Learning Techniques using the 2014 BRFSS was the inspiration for creating this dataset and exploring the BRFSS in general. `https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2019/19_0109.htm`
